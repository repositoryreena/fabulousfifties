      <h2>1950s Fashion: Elegance Meets Everyday</h2>
      <p>Fashion in the 1950s was all about structure, femininity, and charm. After the plainness of wartime, women embraced colorful, curve-enhancing clothes that celebrated the hourglass figure and a polished look.</p>

      <h3>👗 Silhouettes & Staples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Poodle Skirts:</strong> Flared felt skirts often worn with saddle shoes and a tucked-in blouse. A teen girl’s go-to for sock hops and soda shops.</li>
        <li><strong>Wiggle Dresses:</strong> Slim-fitting dresses that hugged the curves — glamorous and flirtatious.</li>
        <li><strong>Circle Dresses:</strong> Cinched waists with wide, flowing skirts — perfect for twirling on a dance floor.</li>
        <li><strong>High-waisted Trousers:</strong> Paired with button-downs or knit tops for casual cool.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🧤 Accessories That Made the Look</h3>
      <p>It wasn't just about the dress — the details mattered. Women in the 1950s perfected every outfit with carefully chosen accessories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gloves:</strong> Essential for church, dates, or shopping. Often white or pastel.</li>
        <li><strong>Pearl Necklaces:</strong> The classic touch of class.</li>
        <li><strong>Cat-eye Glasses:</strong> Stylish and sharp — functional meets fashionable.</li>
        <li><strong>Headscarves & Hats:</strong> From pillbox to wide-brimmed, always coordinated.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🎨 Fabrics & Colors</h3>
      <p>Bright colors, fun prints, and bold checks ruled the decade. Polka dots, florals, and stripes were everywhere. Pastels reigned in spring, while red and navy added bold drama.</p>

      <h3>💄 The Whole Look</h3>
      <p>Hair was curled and coiffed — think victory rolls or a bouffant. Makeup featured bold brows, red lipstick, and fluttery lashes. The goal? Always look “put together,” even on a grocery run.</p>
